My [`CHIRP`](http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home)
config for using my Baofeng UV-5R hand terminal in and around Davis,
California.

The settings for the UV-5R are a bit cryptic, and the manual doesn't
really explain *why* you would use many of the features and modes the
radio provides. The Lake Wales Radio Amateur Radio Club has posted 
[some useful explanations](http://lwra.us/links-2/baofeng-uv5r/) of
the radion's settings, and offers some suggestions relevant for
Amateur radio operators.
